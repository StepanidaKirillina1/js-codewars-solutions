In mathematics, an nth root of a number x, where n is usually assumed to be a positive integer, is a number r which, when raised to the power n, yields x:

r ** n = x

Given number n, such that n > 1, find if its 2nd root, 4th root and 8th root are all integers (fractional part is 0). Return true if yes, false if no.

Examples
// 2nd root of 256 is 16
// 4th root of 256 is 4
// 8th root of 256 is 2
256 --> true 

// 2nd root of 16 is 4
// 4th root of 16 is 2
// 8th root of 16 is 1.4142135... --> not an integer
16 --> false
